    "rationale": "The Setup Wizard is the best fit for CommuniManage because it is a SaaS product aimed at enterprise businesses that require a structured approach to onboarding. Given the complexity of the platform, which includes features like a unified inbox, automated workflows, and advanced analytics, a multi-step setup process is essential to guide users through configuring these capabilities effectively. The onboarding goals emphasize both education about features and the setup of essential communication channels, which aligns perfectly with the setup wizard's purpose of facilitating initial configuration. In contrast, a Feature Discovery Tour would not adequately address the need for multi-step setup and could overwhelm users with information without ensuring they have completed the necessary configurations. Progressive Personalization is also less suitable as it is more appropriate for consumer apps that adapt based on user preferences, whereas CommuniManage focuses on enterprise-level communication management.",
